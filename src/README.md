+ [`parse_offsides.R`](parse_offsides.R) processes OFFSIDES dataset and generates positive/negative samples for four types of organ toxicity. A list of related adverse event (AE) terms were manually curated for each type of organ toxicity. The list can be found [here](../downloads/offsides/offsides_all_adverse_event_names_organ_map.tsv). Positive samples contain drugs that are significantly associated with at least one AE term from the list. Negative samples contain drugs that are significantly associated with none of the AE terms from the list. Definition of significance can be found [here](https://github.com/tatonetti-lab/nsides-release/blob/master/release-notes/v0.1.md). Output can be found [here](../data/offsides/).
